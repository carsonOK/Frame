# ðŸ”· Frame 

Frame is a lightweight Windows app that automatically takes a screenshot every 30 seconds â€” like Microsoft Recall, but without all the heavy requirements or complicated setup.

## Features

- Automatically captures your screen every 30 seconds  
- Runs silently in the background with minimal resource use  
- Simple, no-frills design focused on ease of use  
- No heavy dependencies or complex permissions needed  
- Ideal for productivity tracking, troubleshooting, or quick screen logging

## Installation

### 1. Install Python

- Download and install the latest Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### 2. Download Frame

- Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/carsonOK/Frame/releases) tab.  
- Download the latest `.zip` file and unzip it anywhere you want.

### 3. Install dependencies

- Open **Command Prompt** and navigate to the unzipped Frame folder, e.g.:  `cd C:\Users\admin\downloads\Frame`, and run the following command: `pip install Pillow pystray pywin32`.
